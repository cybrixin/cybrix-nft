## Step 1: About the drawings

Believe it or not, recently whenever I draw something its tends to be creepy, and I end up quitting. To avoid this I am using [DiceBear](https://www.dicebear.com/) to get a set of Scalable Vector Graphics and upload them to <abbr title="Inter Planetary File System">ipfs://</abbr>. Side note, I know these pictures exists and every one can actually find them using the Dicebear API. Oh well ðŸ¤·!
